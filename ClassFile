This will be our first file to be shared with the desktop

Update

We are back at the Repository on the github cloud server

Now we are in the desktop. I have received the last message. 

One more time ... we are at the server side ... and we will go send this to the desktop.

We are on the desktop once again. I will send it back to the repository.
